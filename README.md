Install python on your computer
download repo and save locally
from windows power shell, navigate to the place where the file is held. typing ls gets you a list of all your options. cd gets you to change dirctory, example would be cd \desktop would get you to your desktop. It's called directory navigation if you need to search for help.
once you are in the correct directory, type python ex36.py and hit enter
Play the game

to restart the game after you've died just hit the up arrow and the python ex36.py will re-appear, and hit enter again.
It's not a long game. I'm going to be screwing around with it for the rest of the week tho.
